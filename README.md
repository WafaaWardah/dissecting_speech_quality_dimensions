3. **Data Analysis and Insights:**
   - Conduct in-depth analysis of experimental results, extract insights, and identify patterns in speech quality perception. *(Jan 31st - Feb 5th)*

#### **Phase 4: Presentation and Paper Preparation (February 6th - February 29th, 2024)**

1. **Presentation Slides Creation:**
   - Prepare detailed presentation slides highlighting research objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. *(Feb 6th - Feb 25th)*

2. **Paper Writing and Revision:**
   - Write the research paper, incorporating analysis results and insights, and revise it based on feedback. *(Feb 26th - Feb 29th)*

#### **Phase 5: Final Paper Submission and Rehearsals (March 1st - March 15th, 2024)**

1. **Final Paper Submission:**
   - Make the final revisions to the paper based on feedback and submit it for publication. *(March 1st - March 5th)*

2. **Presentation Rehearsals:**
   - Rehearse the conference presentation multiple times, ensuring a confident and articulate delivery. *(March 6th - March 10th)*

3. **Final Paper Revision:**
